## An Origami Diagramming Tool

The Origrammer is a desktop application for the digital origami diagram creation.

It implements the established origami notation developed by Akira Yoshizawa with additional modifications proposed by Robert J. Lang in [Origami Diagramming Conventions](https://langorigami.com/article/origami-diagramming-conventions/). Refer to the [Origrammer Wiki](https://github.com/JuHardtung/Origrammer/wiki) for more details of all lines, arrows, and symbols and how to use them.

### Virtual Folding

The Origrammer can be used similarly to vector programs like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, where every edge line and all creases are placed by hand. But an important distinction to these programs is that the Origrammer can also simulate paper folding. By placing valley-fold or mountain-fold arrows the user can fold layers of the paper to a specified position. When virtually folding, new folding steps for the diagram are automatically created, which makes the creation process for diagrams faster and more straightforward.
