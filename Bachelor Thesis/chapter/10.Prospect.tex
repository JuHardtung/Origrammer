\label{sec:prospect}

The automation of processes in the Origrammer has changed the workflow of creating diagrams as a whole. Instead of placing lines, arrows, and symbols one by one, the user can simply fold the paper with two mouse clicks and the paper is folded automatically. Furthermore, the correct folding arrow is placed without any additional user input and the following step is started automatically.

With the use of the step navigation, the user can navigate more efficiently and flexible. Steps can be moved, duplicated, deleted and created freely and the preview images of said steps shows the user where he is in the diagram.\\

Further development in the future could improve on the virtual folding, especially for more complex folding actions like rabbit ears, crimps and pleats, reverse folds, and opened/mixed/closed sinks. Another flaw of the current folding system is the inability to display curves and 3d-shaped parts of the origami model. This would be especially important during the shaping process at the end of folding a model.

The user interface is also not final in multiple parts of the Origrammer.
