\section{Evaluating Origrammer}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This evaluation of the Origrammer is supposed to give a basic feedback on which parts of the Origrammer are the most problematic and could benefit from automating parts of their processes. The main metrics of the evaluation will be efficiency or speed of use, which can be measured and systematically determined. Consequently, user involvement in the evaluation is at this stage of development not of significant impact and therefore not applied. Nonetheless, an evaluation with real users should be carried out at a later time before the final release of the program, as even though the duration of certain processes will be reduced during this work, some usability issues can still be overlooked.\\
\newline
As a result of the aforementioned reasons, the evaluation will be carried out using the \emph{10 usability heuristics} by Jakob Nielsen \cite{10usability_heuristics}. These heuristics offer clear reference points to accurately evaluate the Origrammer, though this apporach also brings limitations. This is mentioned by Nielsen and Molich in the proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems from 1990.

\enquote{\emph{A disadvantage of the method is that it sometimes identifies usability problems without providing direct suggestions for how to solve them.}} (Nielsen and Molich, 1990, p. 255 \cite{usability_heuristics})
\end{center}

\noindent This limitation of not providing direct solutions for the identified flaws is why this chapter will focus on finding problems and shortcomings of the Origrammer first. Afterwards, solutions can be developed that optimally address and fix most, or all, discovered issues without contradicting or counteracting other measures. These solutions should prioritize efficiency, giving a clear metric on which one of multiple changes should be implemented.

As I intentionally refrain from end user involvement for this evaluation process, other measures have to be applied to ensure maximum efficiency and thoroughness. This is why the following section shows an exhaustive list of all parts and features of the Origrammer. Figure \ref{fig:origrammerMain} briefly displays the features contained in the Origrammer and their respective location.

\subsection{10 Usability Heuristics}
\label{sec:usabilityHeuristics}

Based on the Origrammer Feature List, the evalutation using the 10 Usability Heuristics can be carried out. Every feature from the list will be checked against all 10 heuristics in order to try and maximise the completeness of the result. The identified usability issues will then lead to the planning of potential usability improvements. Additional focus should be set on the 7th heuristic \emph{Flexibility and Efficiency of Use}, as it includes the main goal of improving the efficiency of creating diagrams with the Origrammer.
